# EchoLens: Hindi Speech-to-Text Smart Glasses (ESP32 + Bluetooth)

EchoLens is a low-cost smart glasses project that helps people who have hearing problems, especially the elderly. It shows live spoken Hindi as text on an OLED screen. The system uses an Android app (made in MIT App Inventor) to convert speech to text and sends it to an ESP32 through Bluetooth.

## 🔧 How It Works

1. The user speaks into the phone.
2. The app changes speech into Hindi text.
3. The text is sent via Bluetooth to the ESP32.
4. The ESP32 shows the text on the OLED display.
